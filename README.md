## About this project

The basic idea behind this project is to make a web application where a traveller can fetch multiple information about his/her destination. In the web application there are mainly two parts, one is map and another is list. User need to type a particular city at search bar then the information regarding that city, Attractions, Hotels, Restaurants all will be present at the list and Map will show those Attractions', Hotels' and Restaurants' address on map itself. One can sort their restaurants, hotels and attractions based on the ratings. Booking details, restaurants' or hotels' own websites are also given to ease the hustle of the travller.
